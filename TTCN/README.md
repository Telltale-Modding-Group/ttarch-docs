# TTCN Parser in TypeScript
This example parser expects the `WDC_pc_ProjectSeason2_ms.ttarch2` archive to be present, and will extract the first
file appearing in the file metadata into this directory.

# Requirements
NodeJS 14+ is required

# Running
Run `npm i` in this directory to install dependencies, then run `npm run start` to run the `index.ts` file.
